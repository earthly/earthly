## Installation Notes

### For Sublime 3

* From Sublime -> `Preferences` -> `Browse Packages` -> This will open a directory
* Copy the `Earthfile.tmLanguage` inside this directory and the syntax will be added to Sublime
* Now you can go to your earthly file in Sublime, `View` -> `Syntax` -> `Earthfile`

### For Sublime 2

* From Sublime -> `Preferences` -> `Browse Packages`
* It will open a directory similar to `<Installation Directory>\Data\Packages`
* It will have a lot of dircetories with language names such as `C++`, `Java`, `Python` and many more.  We need to create a folder called `Earthfile` and copy the `Earthfile.tmLanguage` inside the newly created directory
* Now you can go to your earthly file in Sublime, `View` -> `Syntax` -> `Earthfile`
