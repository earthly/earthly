Mask Detector - By Akash
COVID-19 is a curse to us, How we can fight it is by wearing mask.
Front Line Workers can't risk their lives to take a look on civilians.
Hence we had come up with mask detectors. 


Required Libraries---
 
pip install tensorflow
pip install open-cv python
pip install keras
pip install imutils
pip install numpy

Description - 

This Deep Neural netwok is totally based on Mobile_Net_V2, Used a bit of transfer learning and pooling,
to reduce the size a bit.
The training is done on 20 Epochs, using 224 by 224 as a target.

Rules - 
Place the directory to Desktop
Open Detect.py and specify the path of prototxt and weightres by the path of
deploy.prtotxt and res10.CaffeModel

Also Initialize maskNet to out Main Deep Neural Network Model (The Brain) 
Aka maskDetector.model
