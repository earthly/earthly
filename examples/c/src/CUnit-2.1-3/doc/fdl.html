<P>Version 1.2, November 2002
<P><PRE>Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>0. PREAMBLE</STRONG> 
<P>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other 
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure 
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without 
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License 
preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while 
not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. 
<P>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of 
the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU 
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. 
<P>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free 
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should 
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this 
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, 
regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We 
recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or 
reference. 
<P><STRONG>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</STRONG> 
<P>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that 
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed 
under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free 
license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated 
herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of 
the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if 
you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under 
copyright law. 
<P>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document 
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. 
<P>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the 
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or 
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related 
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall 
subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a 
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a 
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of 
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. 
<P>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are 
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that 
the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above
definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. 
The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not 
identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. 
<P>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as 
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document 
is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a 
Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. 
<P>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, 
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, 
that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text 
editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for 
drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input 
to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable 
for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file 
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or 
discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image 
format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy 
that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque". 
<P>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII 
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a 
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF 
designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include 
PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read 
and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD 
and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated 
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes 
only. 
<P>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such 
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License 
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any 
title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent 
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. 

<P>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title 
either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that 
translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name 
mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or 
"History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the 
Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this 
definition. 
<P>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states 
that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are 
considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards 
disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers 
may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 
<P><STRONG>2. VERBATIM COPYING</STRONG> 
<P>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially 
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the 
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all 
copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this 
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading 
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept 
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of 
copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. 
<P>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may 
publicly display copies. 
<P><STRONG>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</STRONG> 
<P>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed 
covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license 
notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, 
clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front 
cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and 
legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must 
present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and 
visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with 
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the 
Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in 
other respects. 
<P>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you 
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual 
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. 
<P>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more 
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with 
each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network 
location from which the general network-using public has access to download 
using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the 
Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take 
reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in 
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at 
the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute 
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to 
the public. 
<P>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the 
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a 
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 
<P><STRONG>4. MODIFICATIONS</STRONG> 
<P>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the 
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified 
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role 
of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified 
Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things 
in the Modified Version: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a 
  title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions 
  (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the 
  Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original 
  publisher of that version gives permission. 
  <LI><STRONG>B.</STRONG> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more 
  persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the 
  Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the 
  Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless 
  they release you from this requirement. 
  <LI><STRONG>C.</STRONG> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of 
  the Modified Version, as the publisher. 
  <LI><STRONG>D.</STRONG> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
  <LI><STRONG>E.</STRONG> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your 
  modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
  <LI><STRONG>F.</STRONG> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a 
  license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under 
  the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
  <LI><STRONG>G.</STRONG> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of 
  Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license 
  notice. 
  <LI><STRONG>H.</STRONG> Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
  <LI><STRONG>I.</STRONG> Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its 
  Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, 
  and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is 
  no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, 
  year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then 
  add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous 
  sentence. 
  <LI><STRONG>J.</STRONG> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the 
  Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise 
  the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based 
  on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network 
  location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document 
  itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives 
  permission. 
  <LI><STRONG>K.</STRONG> For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or 
  "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section 
  all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or 
  dedications given therein. 
  <LI><STRONG>L.</STRONG> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, 
  unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent 
  are not considered part of the section titles. 
  <LI><STRONG>M.</STRONG> Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a 
  section may not be included in the Modified Version. 
  <LI><STRONG>N.</STRONG> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled 
  "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. 
  <LI><STRONG>O.</STRONG> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. </LI></UL>
<P>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that 
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, 
you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To 
do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified 
Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section 
titles. 
<P>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing 
but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, 
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization 
as the authoritative definition of a standard. 
<P>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a 
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover 
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of 
Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one 
entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, 
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting 
on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on 
explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. 
<P>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give 
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply 
endorsement of any Modified Version. 
<P><STRONG>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</STRONG> 
<P>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this 
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, 
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of 
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant 
Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all 
their Warranty Disclaimers. 
<P>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple 
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are 
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the 
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, 
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a 
unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of 
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. 
<P>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the 
various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise 
combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled 
"Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements." 
<P><STRONG>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</STRONG> 
<P>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents 
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License 
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, 
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each 
of the documents in all other respects. 
<P>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it 
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into 
the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding 
verbatim copying of that document. 
<P><STRONG>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</STRONG> 
<P>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and 
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution 
medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation 
is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the 
individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this 
License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not 
themselves derivative works of the Document. 
<P>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of 
the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire 
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the 
Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the 
Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers 
that bracket the whole aggregate. 
<P><STRONG>8. TRANSLATION</STRONG> 
<P>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute 
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant 
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright 
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in 
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a 
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and 
any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English 
version of this License and the original versions of those notices and 
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original 
version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will 
prevail. 
<P>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", 
or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will 
typically require changing the actual title. 
<P><STRONG>9. TERMINATION</STRONG> 
<P>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as 
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
<P><STRONG>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</STRONG> 
<P>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU 
Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar 
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new 
problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. 
<P>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the 
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any 
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has 
been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document 
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version 
ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. 
<P>
<H2><A href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html#TOC4" name=SEC4>How to use 
this License for your documents</A></H2>
<P>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the 
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just 
after the title page: 
<P><PRE>      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
	 Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</PRE>
<P>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, 
replace the "with...Texts." line with this: 
<P><PRE>    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
</PRE>
<P>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination 
of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. 
<P>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend 
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, 
such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
