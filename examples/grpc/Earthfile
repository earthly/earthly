# This example shows how to use earthly to compile a protobuf grpc definition
# into protobuf code for both a Go-based server, and a python-based client.
#
# This example spans 4 different git repositories, each containing an Earthfile:
#
# 1) https://github.com/earthly/earthly-example-proto
# This repository contains the api.proto defitniton along with an Earthfile
# which installs the various protoc tools required to generate the go and python
# code.
#
# 2) https://github.com/earthly/earthly-example-proto-server
# This repository contains a server written in go along with an Earthfile
# that pulls in the auto-generated go code from repo 1.
#
# 3) https://github.com/earthly/earthly-example-proto-python-client
# This repository contains a client written in python along with an Earthfile
# that pulls in the auto-generated python code from repo 1.

# 4) finally, in this Earthfile, we pull in both the server and client docker
# images, and perform a basic integration test where we:
#   a) start up the server,
#   b) store the value "salmon" under the key "fish"
#   c) retrieve the stored value for "fish", then finally
#   d) use grep to test that "salmon" was returned.
