# Detailed explanation

Going back to the example earthfile definition, here is what each command does:

{% method %}
{% sample lang="Go" %}
The first commands in the file are part of the `base` target and are implicitly inherited by all other targets (as if they started with `FROM +base`).

The build starts from a docker image: `golang:1.15-alpine3.13`.

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.15-alpine3.13
```

We change the current working directory to `/go-example`.

```Dockerfile
WORKDIR /go-example
```

Declare a target, `build`. (This target may be invoked from the command line as `earthly +build`.)

```Dockerfile
build:
```

... and define the recipe of the target `build` as follows.

Copy `main.go` from the build context (the directory where the Earthfile resides) to the build environment (the containerized environment where Earthly commands are ran in).

```Dockerfile
    COPY main.go .
```

Run a go build command. This uses the previously copied `main.go` file.

```Dockerfile
    RUN go build -o build/go-example main.go
```

Save the output of the build command as an artifact. Call this artifact `/go-example` (it can be later referenced as `+build/go-example`). In addition, store the artifact as a local file (on the host) named `build/go-example`. This local file is only written if the entire build succeeds.

```Dockerfile
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/go-example /go-example AS LOCAL build/go-example
```

Declare a target, `docker`.

```Dockerfile
docker:
```

... and define the recipe of the target docker as follows.

Copy the artifact `/go-example` produced by another target, `+build`, to the current directory within the build environment.

```Dockerfile
    COPY +build/go-example .
```

Set the entrypoint for the resulting docker image.

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/go-example/go-example"]
```

Save the current state as a docker image, which will have the docker tag `go-example:latest`. This image is only made available to the host's docker if the entire build succeeds.

```Dockerfile
SAVE IMAGE go-example:latest
```

{% sample lang="JavaScript" %}
The first commands in the file are part of the `base` target and are implicitly inherited by all other targets (as if they started with `FROM +base`).

The build starts from a docker image: `node:13.10.1-alpine3.11`.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:13.10.1-alpine3.11
```

We change the current working directory to `/js-example`.

```
WORKDIR /js-example
```

Declare a target, `build`. (This target may be invoked from the command line as `earthly +build`.)

```
build:
```

... and define the recipe of the target `build` as follows.

Copy `index.js` from the build context (the directory where the Earthfile resides) to the build environment (the containerized environment where Earthly commands are ran in).

```
    COPY src/index.js .
```

Save the `index.js` in an artifact dir called `dist` (it can be later
referenced as `+build/dist`). In addition, store the artifact as a
local file (on the host) named `dist/index.js`. This local file is only
written if the entire build succeeds.

```
    SAVE ARTIFACT index.js /dist/index.js AS LOCAL ./dist/index.js
```

Declare a target, `docker`.

```
docker:
```

... and define the recipe of the target `docker` as follows.

Copy the artifact `/dist` produced by another target, `+build`, to the
current directory within the build container.

```
    COPY +build/dist dist
```

Set the entrypoint for the resulting docker image.

```
    ENTRYPOINT ["node", "./dist/index.js"]
```

Save the current state as a docker image, which will have the docker tag
`js-example:latest`. This image is only made available to the host's docker
if the entire build succeeds.

```
    SAVE IMAGE js-example:latest
```

{% sample lang="Java" %}
The first commands in the file are part of the `base` target and are implicitly inherited by all other targets (as if they started with `FROM +base`).

The build starts from a docker image: `openjdk:8-jdk-alpine`.

```
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
```

We install `gradle` using alpine's `apk` command.

```
RUN apk add --update --no-cache gradle
```

We change the current working directory to `/java-example`.

```
WORKDIR /java-example
```

Declare a target, `build`. (This target may be invoked from the command line as `earthly +build`.)

```
build:
```

... and define the recipe of the target build as follows.

Copy `build.gradle` and `src` from the build context (the directory where the Earthfile resides) to the build environment (the containerized environment where Earthly commands are ran in).

```
    COPY build.gradle ./
    COPY src src
```

Run the `gradle build` and `gradle install` commands. These use the previously copied `src` dir.

```
    RUN gradle build
    RUN gradle install
```

Save the output of the build command as artifacts. Call these
artifacts `bin` and `lib` (they can be later referenced as `+build/bin` and
`+build/lib` respectively).
In addition, store the artifacts as local dirs (on the host) named
`build/bin` and `build/lib`. These local dirs are only written if the entire
build succeeds.

```
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/install/java-example/bin /bin AS LOCAL build/bin
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/install/java-example/lib /lib AS LOCAL build/lib
```

Declare a target, `docker`.

```
docker:
```

... and define the recipe of the target docker as follows.

Copy the artifacts `/bin` and `/lib` produced by another target, `+build`, to
the current directory within the build container.

```
    COPY +build/bin bin
    COPY +build/lib lib
```

Set the entrypoint for the resulting docker image.

```
    ENTRYPOINT ["/java-example/bin/java-example"]
```

Save the current state as a docker image, which will have the docker tag
`java-example:latest`. This image is only made available to the host's
docker if the entire build succeeds.

```
    SAVE IMAGE java-example:latest
```
{% sample lang="Python" %}
The first commands in the file are part of the `base` target and are implicitly inherited by all other targets (as if they started with `FROM +base`).

The build starts from the `python:3` docker image.

```
FROM python:3
```

We change the current working directory to `/code`.

```
WORKDIR /code
```

Declare a target, `build`. (This target may be invoked from the command line as `earthly +build`.)

```
build:
```

... and define the recipe of the target `build` as follows.

Copy the `src` dir from the build context (the directory where the Earthfile resides) to the build environment (the containerized environment where Earthly commands are ran in).

```
    COPY src src
```

Save the python source in an artifact dir called src (it can be later referenced as `+build/src`).

```
    SAVE ARTIFACT src /src
```

Declare a target, `docker`.

```
docker:
```

... and define the recipe of the target docker as follows.

Copy the artifact `/src` from the target `+build` into the current directory within the build container.

```
    COPY +build/src src
```

Set the entrypoint for the resulting docker image.

```
    ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "./src/hello.py"]
```

Save the current state as a docker image, which will have the docker tag
`python-example:latest`. This image is only made available to the host's docker
if the entire build succeeds.

```
    SAVE IMAGE python-example:latest
```

##### Note

Targets have a particular referencing convention which helps Earthly to identify which recipe to execute. In the simplest form, targets are referenced by `+<target-name>`.  For example, `+build`. For more details see the [target referencing page](../guides/target-ref.md).
