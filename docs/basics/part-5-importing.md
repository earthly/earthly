## Calling on Targets From Other Earthfiles

So far we've seen how the `FROM` command in Earthly has the ability to reference another target's image as its base image, like in the case below where the `+build` target uses the image from the `+deps` target.

```Dockerfile
VERSION 0.7
FROM golang:1.15-alpine3.13
WORKDIR /go-workdir

deps:
    COPY go.mod go.sum ./
    RUN go mod download
    # Output these back in case go mod download changes them.
    SAVE ARTIFACT go.mod AS LOCAL go.mod
    SAVE ARTIFACT go.sum AS LOCAL go.sum

build:
    FROM +deps
    COPY main.go .
    RUN go build -o output/example main.go
    SAVE ARTIFACT output/example AS LOCAL local-output/go-example

```

But `FROM` also has the ability to import targets from Earthfiles in different directories. Let's say we have a directory structure like this.

```
.
├── services
|   └── service-one
|       ├── Earthfile (containing +deps)
|       ├── go.mod
|       └── go.sum
├── main.go
└── Earthfile

```
We can use a target in the Earthfile in `/services/service-one` from inside the Earthfile in the root of our directory. NOTE: relative paths must use `./` or `../`.

`./services/service-one/Earthfile`

```Dockerfile

VERSION 0.7
FROM golang:1.15-alpine3.13
WORKDIR /go-workdir

deps:
    COPY go.mod go.sum ./
    RUN go mod download
    # Output these back in case go mod download changes them.
    SAVE ARTIFACT go.mod AS LOCAL go.mod
    SAVE ARTIFACT go.sum AS LOCAL go.sum
```

`./Earthfile`

```Dockerfile
build:
    FROM ./services/service-one+deps
    COPY main.go .
    RUN go build -o output/example main.go
    SAVE ARTIFACT output/example AS LOCAL local-output/go-example
```
This code tells `FROM` that there is another Earthfile in  the `services/service-one` directory and that the Earthfile  contains a target called `+deps`. In this case, if we were to run `+build` Earthly is smart enough to go into the subdirectory, run the  `+deps` target in that Earthfile, and then use it as the base image for `+build`.

We can also reference an Earthfile in another repo, which works in a similar way. If the reference does not begin with one of `/`, `./`, or `../`, then earthly treats it as a repository.  See [the reference](../earthfile/earthfile.md#from) for details.

```Dockerfile
build:
    FROM github.com/example/project+remote-target
    COPY main.go .
    RUN go build -o output/example main.go
    SAVE ARTIFACT output/example AS LOCAL local-output/go-example
```

## Importing Whole Projects
In addition to importing single targets from other files, we can also import an entire Earthfile with the `IMPORT` command. This is helpful if there are several targets in a separate Earthfile that you want access to in your current file. It also allows you to create an alias.

```Dockerfile
VERSION 0.7
IMPORT ./services/service-one AS my_service
FROM golang:1.15-alpine3.13
WORKDIR /go-workdir

build:
    FROM my_service+deps
    COPY main.go .
    RUN go build -o output/example main.go
    SAVE ARTIFACT output/example AS LOCAL local-output/go-example
```
In this example, we assume there is a `./services/service-one` directory that contains its own Earthfile. We import it and then use the `AS` keyword to give it an alias.

Then, in our `+build` target we can inherit from any target in the imported Earthfile by passing `alias+target-name`. In this case the Earthfile in the service directory has a target named `+deps`.
