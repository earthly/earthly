# Detailed explanation

Going back to the example earthfile definition, here is what each command does:

{% method %}
{% sample lang="Go" %}
```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

# The build starts from a docker image: golang:1.15-alpine3.13
FROM golang:1.15-alpine3.13
# We change the current working directory.
WORKDIR /go-example

# The above commands are inherited implicitly by all targets below
# (as if they started with FROM +base).

# Declare a target, build.
build:
    # Define the recipe of the target build as follows:

    # Copy main.go from the build context to the build environment.
    COPY main.go .
    # Run a go build command.
    # This uses the previously copied main.go file.
    RUN go build -o build/go-example main.go
    # Save the output of the build command as an artifact. Call this
    # artifact /go-example (it can be later referenced as +build/go-example).
    # In addition, store the artifact as a local file (on the host) named
    # build/go-example. This local file is only written if the entire build
    # succeeds.
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/go-example /go-example AS LOCAL build/go-example

# Declare a target, docker.
docker:
    # Define the recipe of the target docker as follows:

    # Copy the artifact /go-example produced by another target, +build, to the
    # current directory within the build container.
    COPY +build/go-example .
    # Set the entrypoint for the resulting docker image.
    ENTRYPOINT ["/go-example/go-example"]
    # Save the current state as a docker image, which will have the docker tag
    # go-example:latest. This image is only made available to the host's docker
    # if the entire build succeeds.
    SAVE IMAGE go-example:latest
```

{% sample lang="Java" %}
```Dockerfile
