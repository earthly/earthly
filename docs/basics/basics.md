# Introduction

Earthly is a build automation tool that uses docker containers to enforce build repeatability. Earthly is meant to be run on your local system and in your CI. Earthly's implicit caching and parallelism will make your builds repeatable and fast.

This tutorial will walk you through a basic example of using Earthly.
