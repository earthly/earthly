## Examples by dev environments

Examples of how Earthly can be integrated into different dev environments

* [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/earthly/codespaces-example) - shows how Earthly can be used in GitHub Codespaces and Devcontainers

## Example Earthfiles

In this section, you will find some examples of Earthfiles to familiarize yourself with Earthly.

The code for all the examples is available in the [examples GitHub directory](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples).

### Examples by use-cases

* [integration-test](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples/integration-test) - shows how `WITH DOCKER` and `docker-compose` can be used to start up services and then run an integration test suite.
* [monorepo](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples/monorepo) - shows how multiple sub-projects can be co-located in a single repository and how the build can be fragmented across these.
* [multirepo](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples/multirepo) - shows how artifacts from multiple repositories can be referenced in a single build. See also the `grpc` example for a more extensive use-case.

### Examples by Earthly features

* [import](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples/import) - shows how to use the `IMPORT` command to alias project references.
* [cutoff-optimization](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples/cutoff-optimization) - shows that if an intermediate artifact does not change, then the rest of the build will use the cache, even if the source has changed.
* [multiplatform](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples/multiplatform) - shows how Earthly can execute builds and create images for multiple platforms, using QEMU emulation.
* [multiplatform-cross-compile](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples/multiplatform-cross-compile) - shows has through the use of cross-compilation, you can create images for multiple platforms, without using QEMU emulation.

### Examples by use of other technologies

* [grpc](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples/grpc) - shows how to use Earthly to compile a protobuf grpc definition into protobuf code for both a Go-based server, and a python-based client, in a multirepo setup.
* [terraform](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/examples/terraform) - shows how Terraform could be used from Earthly.

* [tests](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/tests) - a suite of tests Earthly uses to ensure that its features are working correctly.

### Earthly's own build

As a distinct example of a complete build, you can take a look at Earthly's own build. Earthly builds itself, and the build files are available on GitHub:

<!--

GitBook currently has a bug where any references to an "Earthfile" gets confused with "docs/Earthfile" and somehow appends a /README.md

e.g. https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/main/Earthfile is changed to https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/main/Earthfile/README.md

Here's a snip from an support request with gitbook:

    There is a file:

    https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/main/Earthfile

    And you want to reference it directly in your GitBook space as a link.

    The problem here is that GitBook is thrown off by the fact it has a folder under the docs root. Remember you documentation root is set to /docs.

    So when it sees that reference, it assumes you are referencing a default README.md file under that folder. The folder I am talking about is this one:

    https://github.com/earthly/earthly/tree/main/docs/earthfile

    Now, the question is, if there's an easy way out of this.

    I can't confirm it yet, but this might be an edge case that we could patch.

    One not very ideal workaround I thought of is to temporarily switch to shortened URLs for those that fail because of this scenario.
