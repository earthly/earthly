## Getting started

### Creating an account

To get started with Earthly Cloud, you'll need to register an Earthly account. You can do so by visiting [Earthly Cloud Sign up page](https://cloud.earthly.dev/login), or by using the CLI as described below.

```bash
earthly account register --email <email>
```

An email will be sent to you containing a verification token. Next run:

```bash
earthly account register --email <email> --token <token>
```

This command will prompt you to set a password, and to optionally register a public-key for password-less authentication.

### Creating or joining an Earthly org

An Earthly org allows you to share projects, secrets, satellites and pipelines with colleagues. To view the orgs you belong to, run:

```bash
earthly org ls
```

To create an Earthly org you can run:

```bash
earthly org create <org-name>
```

To select the org you would like to use, run:

```bash
earthly org select <org-name>
```

To invite another user to join your org, run:

```bash
earthly org invite <email>
```

You can join an Earthly org by following the steps outlined in the invitation email sent to you by an Earthly admin.

### Creating a project

To use certain features, Earthly Cloud Secrets, you will additionally need to create an Earthly Project. You can create a project by using the CLI as described below.

```bash
earthly project create <project-name>
```

## Logging in from a CI

To be able to use certain Earthly features, such as Cloud Secrets, or Satellites from your CI, you will need to log into Earthly. The easiest way to do that is to create an Earthly authentication token by running

```bash
earthly account create-token [--write] <token-name>
```

This token can then be exported as an environment variable in the CI of choice.

```bash
EARTHLY_TOKEN=...
```

Which will then force Earthly to use that token when accessing secrets or satellites.
