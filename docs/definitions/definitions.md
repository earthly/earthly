This page presents some common terms used throughout the earthly documentation.  Understanding these terms with help you understand how to use earthly. 

* **Earthly** - the build automation system as a whole
* **`earth`** - the CLI tool used to interact with Earthly
* **Earthfile** - a file (named literally `Earthfile`) which contains a series of targets and their respective recipes
* **buildkitd** - a [daemon built by the Docker team](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) and used by Earthly to execute builds. It executes LLB, the same low-level primitives used when building Dockerfiles. The buildkitd daemon is started automatically in a docker container, by `earth`, when executing builds.

* **target** - the label used to identify a recipe. 'Target' is also used to refer to a build of a specific target.
