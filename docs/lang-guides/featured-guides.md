# Featured guides

We are working on a series of [language-specific libraries](../earthly-lib/earthly-lib.md) that make Earthly that much easier to use with various languages and frameworks. To that end, we are starting with [Rust](./rust.md).

If you are looking for additional examples for other languages, checkout the [onboarding tutorial in Earthly Cloud](https://cloud.earthly.dev/login), or the [examples page](../examples/examples.md).
