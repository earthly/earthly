Earthly works with any programming language, as shown in our extensive collection of [examples](../examples/examples.md). However, we are now working on a series of [language-specific libraries](../earthly-lib/earthly-lib.md) that make Earthly that much easier to use with various languages and frameworks. To that end, we are starting with [Rust](./rust.md).

If you are just starting out, the [onboarding tutorial in Earthly Cloud](https://cloud.earthly.dev/login) is a great way to get introduced to Earthly.
