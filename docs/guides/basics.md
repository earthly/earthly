# Basics

Earthly is a build automation tool where docker containers are used to enforce reproducibility. Earthly is meant to be run on your local system and in your CI.  Implicit caching and parallelism mean your build will be reproducible and fast.

Let's walk through a basic example of using Earthly.

## Installation

Before going any further, it is advisable that you install `earth` on your computer, so you can follow along and try out the examples. See the [installation page](../installation/installation.md).

## A simple Earthfile

Earthfiles are always named `Earthfile`, regardless of their location in the codebase.

{% method %}
{% sample lang="Go" %}
Here is a sample earthfile of a Go app

```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM golang:1.13-alpine3.11
WORKDIR /go-example

build:
    COPY main.go .
    RUN go build -o build/go-example main.go
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/go-example /go-example AS LOCAL build/go-example

docker:
    COPY +build/go-example .
    ENTRYPOINT ["/go-example/go-example"]
    SAVE IMAGE go-example:latest
```

The code of the app might look like this

```go
// main.go

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

{% sample lang="JavaScript" %}
Here is a sample earthfile of a JS app

```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM node:13.10.1-alpine3.11
WORKDIR /js-example

build:
    # In JS, there's nothing to build in this simple form.
    # The source is also the artifact used in production.
    COPY index.js .
    SAVE ARTIFACT index.js /dist/index.js AS LOCAL ./dist/index.js

docker:
    COPY +build/dist dist
    ENTRYPOINT ["node", "./dist/index.js"]
    SAVE IMAGE js-example:latest
```

The code of the app might look like this

```js
// index.js

console.log("hello world");
```

{% sample lang="Java" %}
Here is a sample earthfile of a Java app

```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
RUN apk add --update --no-cache gradle
WORKDIR /java-example

build:
    COPY build.gradle ./
    COPY src src
    RUN gradle build
    RUN gradle install
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/install/java-example/bin /bin AS LOCAL build/bin
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/install/java-example/lib /lib AS LOCAL build/lib

docker:
    COPY +build/bin bin
    COPY +build/lib lib
    ENTRYPOINT ["/java-example/bin/java-example"]
    SAVE IMAGE java-example:latest
```

The code of the app might look like this

```java
// src/main/java/hello/HelloWorld.java

package hello;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world");
    }
}
```
{% sample lang="Python" %}
Here is a sample earthfile of a Python app

```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM python:3
WORKDIR /code

build:
     # In Python, there's nothing to build.
    COPY src src
    SAVE ARTIFACT src /src

docker:
    COPY +build/src src
    ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "./src/hello.py"]
    SAVE IMAGE python-example:latest
```

The code of the app might look like this

```python
// src/hello.py

print("hello world")
```
{% endmethod %}

You will notice that the recipes look very much like Dockerfiles. This is an intentional design decision. Existing Dockerfiles can be ported to earthfiles by copy-pasting them over and then tweaking them slightly. Compared to Dockerfile syntax, some commands are new (like `SAVE ARTIFACT`), others have additional semantics (like `COPY +target/some-artifact`) and other semantics are removed (like `FROM ... AS ...` and `COPY --from`).

## Executing a build

In this particular example, we can see two explicit targets: `build` and `docker`. In order to execute the build, we can run, for example:

```bash
earth +build
```

or

```bash
earth +docker
```

The output might look like this:

![Earth build output](img/go-example.png)

Notice how to the left of `|`, within the output, we can see some targets like `+base`, `+build` and `+docker` . Notice how the output is interleaved between `+docker` and `+build`. This is because the system executes independent build steps in parallel. The reason this is possible effortlessly is because only very few things are shared between the builds of the recipes and those things are declared and obvious. The rest is completely isolated.

In addition, notice how even though the base is used as part of both `build` and `docker`, it is only executed once. This is because the system deduplicates execution, where possible.

Furthermore, the fact that the `docker` target depends on the `build` target is visible within the command `COPY +build/...`. Through this command, the system knows that it also needs to build the target `+build`, in order to satisfy the dependency on the artifact.

Finally, notice how the output of the build: the docker image `go-example:latest` and the file `build/go-example` is only written after the build is declared a success. This is due to another isolation principle of Earthly: a build either succeeds completely or it fails altogether.

Once the build has executed, we can run the resulting docker image to try it out:

{% method %}
{% sample lang="Go" %}
```
$ docker run --rm go-example:latest
hello world
```
{% sample lang="JavaScript" %}
```
$ docker run --rm js-example:latest
hello world
```
{% sample lang="Java" %}
```
$ docker run --rm java-example:latest
hello world
```
{% sample lang="Python" %}
```
$ docker run --rm python-example:latest
hello world
```
{% endmethod %}

{% hint style='info' %}
##### Note

Targets have a particular referencing convention which helps Earthly to identify which recipe to execute. In the simplest form, targets are referenced by `+<target-name>`.  For example, `+build`. For more details see the [target referencing page](./target-ref.md).
{% endhint %}

## Detailed explanation

Going back to the example earthfile definition, here is what each command does:

{% method %}
{% sample lang="Go" %}
```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

    COPY main.go .
    # Run a go build command.
    # This uses the previously copied main.go file.
    RUN go build -o build/go-example main.go
    # Save the output of the build command as an artifact. Call this
    # artifact /go-example (it can be later referenced as +build/go-example).
    # In addition, store the artifact as a local file (on the host) named
    # build/go-example. This local file is only written if the entire build
    # succeeds.
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/go-example /go-example AS LOCAL build/go-example

    SAVE IMAGE python-example:latest

```
{% endmethod %}

## Adding dependencies in the mix

Let's imagine now that in our simple app, we now want to add a programming language dependency. Here's how our build might look like as a result

{% method %}
{% sample lang="Go" %}
```go.mod
// go.mod

module github.com/earthly/earthly/examples/go

go 1.13

require github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.5.0
```

The code of the app might look like this

```go
// main.go

package main

import "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"

func main() {
	logrus.Info("hello world")
}
```

The build then might become

```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM golang:1.13-alpine3.11
WORKDIR /go-example

build:
    COPY go.mod go.sum .
    COPY main.go .
    RUN go build -o build/go-example main.go
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/go-example /go-example AS LOCAL build/go-example

docker:
    COPY +build/go-example .
    ENTRYPOINT ["/go-example/go-example"]
    SAVE IMAGE go-example:latest
```
{% sample lang="JavaScript" %}
```json
// package.json

{
  "name": "example-js",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Hello world",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "MPL-2.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^4.42.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.11"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "http-server": "^0.12.1"
  }
}
```

The code of the app might look like this

```js
// src/index.js

function component() {
    const element = document.createElement('div');
    element.innerHTML = "hello world"
    return element;
}

document.body.appendChild(component());
```

```html
<!-- dist/index.html -->

<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Getting Started</title>
</head>

<body>
    <script src="./main.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

The build then might become

```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM node:13.10.1-alpine3.11
WORKDIR /js-example

build:
    COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
    COPY src src
    COPY dist dist
    RUN npm install
    RUN npx webpack
    SAVE ARTIFACT dist /dist AS LOCAL ./dist

docker:
    COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY +build/dist dist
    ENTRYPOINT ["node", "./dist/index.js"]
    SAVE IMAGE js-example:latest
```
{% sample lang="Java" %}
```groovy
// build.gradle

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'application'

mainClassName = 'hello.HelloWorld'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

jar {
    baseName = 'hello-world'
    version = '0.0.1'
}

sourceCompatibility = 1.8
targetCompatibility = 1.8

dependencies {
    compile "joda-time:joda-time:2.2"
    testCompile "junit:junit:4.12"
}
```

The code of the app might look like this

```java
// src/main/java/hello/HelloWorld.java

package hello;

import org.joda.time.LocalTime;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalTime currentTime = new LocalTime();
        System.out.println(currentTime + " - hello world");
    }
}
```

The Earthfile file would not change

```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
RUN apk add --update --no-cache gradle
WORKDIR /java-example

build:
    COPY build.gradle ./
    COPY src src
    RUN gradle build
    RUN gradle install
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/install/java-example/bin /bin AS LOCAL build/bin
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/install/java-example/lib /lib AS LOCAL build/lib

docker:
    COPY +build/bin bin
    COPY +build/lib lib
    ENTRYPOINT ["/java-example/bin/java-example"]
    SAVE IMAGE java-example:latest
```
{% sample lang="Python" %}
```
// Requirements.txt

Markdown==3.2.2
```
The code of the app would now look like this
```python
# src/hello.py

from markdown import markdown

def hello():
    return markdown("Hello *Earthly*")

print(hello())
```
The build might then become as follows.  
```Docker
# EarthFile

FROM python:3
WORKDIR /code

build:
    # Use Python Wheels to produce package files into /wheels
    RUN pip install wheel
    COPY requirements.txt ./
    RUN pip wheel -r requirements.txt --wheel-dir=wheels
    COPY src src
    SAVE ARTIFACT src /src
    SAVE ARTIFACT wheels /wheels

docker:
    COPY +build/src src
    COPY +build/wheels wheels
    COPY requirements.txt ./
    RUN pip install --no-index --find-links=wheels -r requirements.txt
    ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "./src/hello.py"]
    SAVE IMAGE python-example:latest
```
{% endmethod %}

However, as we build this new setup and make changes to the main source code, we notice that the dependencies are downloaded every single time we change the source code. While the build is not necessarily incorrect, it is inefficient for proper development speed.

## Efficient caching of dependencies

The reason the build is inefficient is because we have not made proper use of caching. When a file changes, the corresponding `COPY` command is re-executed without cache, causing all commands after it to also re-execute without cache.

If, however, we could first download the dependencies and only afterwards copy and build the code, then the cache would be reused every time we changed the code.

{% method %}
{% sample lang="Go" %}

docker:

    COPY +build/lib lib
    ENTRYPOINT ["/java-example/bin/java-example"]
    SAVE IMAGE java-example:latest
```
{% sample lang="Python" %}
```Docker

FROM python:3
WORKDIR /code

build:
    RUN pip install wheel
    COPY requirements.txt ./
    RUN pip wheel -r requirements.txt --wheel-dir=wheels

    #save wheels before copy source, for cache efficiency 
    SAVE ARTIFACT wheels /wheels

    COPY src src
    SAVE ARTIFACT src /src

docker:
    COPY +build/src src
    COPY +build/wheels wheels
    COPY requirements.txt ./
    RUN pip install --no-index --find-links=wheels -r requirements.txt

    SAVE IMAGE python-example:latest
```
{% endmethod %}

For a primer into Dockerfile layer caching see [this article](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-caching-model/). The same principles apply to Earthfiles.

## Reduce code duplication

In some cases, the dependencies might be used in more than one build target. For this usecase, we might want to separate dependency downloading and reuse it. For this reason, let's consider breaking this out into a separate build target, called `deps`. We can then inherit from `deps` by using the command `FROM +deps`.

Note that in our case, only the JavaScript version has an example where `FROM +deps` is used in more than one place: both in `build` and in `docker`. Nevertheless, all versions show how dependencies may be separated.

{% method %}
{% sample lang="Go" %}
```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM golang:1.13-alpine3.11
WORKDIR /go-example

deps:
    COPY go.mod go.sum ./
	RUN go mod download
	SAVE ARTIFACT go.mod AS LOCAL go.mod
	SAVE ARTIFACT go.sum AS LOCAL go.sum
	SAVE IMAGE

build:
    FROM +deps
    COPY main.go .
    RUN go build -o build/go-example main.go
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/go-example /go-example AS LOCAL build/go-example

docker:
    COPY +build/go-example .
    ENTRYPOINT ["/go-example/go-example"]
    SAVE IMAGE go-example:latest
```
{% sample lang="JavaScript" %}
```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM node:13.10.1-alpine3.11
WORKDIR /js-example

deps:
    COPY package.json ./
    COPY package-lock.json ./
    RUN npm install
    SAVE ARTIFACT package.json AS LOCAL ./package.json
    SAVE ARTIFACT package-lock.json AS LOCAL ./package-lock.json
    SAVE IMAGE

build:

    SAVE IMAGE js-example:latest
```
{% sample lang="Java" %}
```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
RUN apk add --update --no-cache gradle
WORKDIR /java-example

deps:
    COPY build.gradle ./
    RUN gradle build
    SAVE IMAGE

build:
    FROM +deps
    COPY src src
    RUN gradle build
    RUN gradle install
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/install/java-example/bin AS LOCAL build/bin
    SAVE ARTIFACT build/install/java-example/lib AS LOCAL build/lib

docker:
    COPY +build/bin bin
    COPY +build/lib lib
    ENTRYPOINT ["/java-example/bin/java-example"]
    SAVE IMAGE java-example:latest
```
{% sample lang="Python" %}
```Dockerfile
# Earthfile

FROM python:3
WORKDIR /code

deps:
    RUN pip install wheel
    COPY requirements.txt ./
    RUN pip wheel -r requirements.txt --wheel-dir=wheels
    SAVE IMAGE

build:
    FROM +deps
    COPY src src

    SAVE ARTIFACT wheels /wheels

docker:

    RUN pip install --no-index --find-links=wheels -r requirements.txt
    ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "./src/hello.py"]
    SAVE IMAGE python-example:latest
```
{% endmethod %}

Notice how at the end of the `deps` recipe, we issued a `SAVE IMAGE` command. In this case, it is not for the purpose of saving as an image that would be used outside of the build: the command has no docker tag associated with it. Instead, it is for the purpose of reusing the image within the build, from another target (via `FROM +deps`).
