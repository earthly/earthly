# Pushing and Pulling images with GCP Artifact Registry

## Introduction

The GCP Artifact Registry is a hosted docker repository that requires extra configuration for day-to-day use. This configuration is not typical of other repositories, and there are some considerations to account for when using it with Earthly. This guide will walk you through creating an Earthfile, building an image, and pushing it to Artifact Registry.

[Artifact Registry is the successor to the GCP Container Registry (GCR)](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/transition-from-gcr). It can accomodate more than just Docker images, but those are beyond the scope of this guide. Most of what we detail here applies to GCR as well, it will just require some small tweaks. You can see a list of tweaks you will need to make [here](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/transition-from-gcr#compare).

This guide assumes you have already installed the [gcloud CLI tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install), [enabled the Artifact Repository API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=artifactregistry.googleapis.com&redirect=https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/quickstart), and [created a new repository named `hello-earthly`](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts).

## Create an Earthfile

No special considerations are needed in the Earthfile itself. You can use `SAVE IMAGE` just like any other repository.

```
FROM alpine:3.11

build:
    RUN echo "Hello from Earthly!" > motd
    ENTRYPOINT cat motd
    SAVE IMAGE --push <region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project>/hello-earthly/hello-earthly:with-love
```

## Configure the Artifact Repository Credential Helper

Artifact Repository does not issue permanent credentials. Instead, it relies on your Google credentials to issue Docker credentials. To this end, Google has built-in a credential helper to the `gcloud` CLI tool. `gcloud` can update your `.docker/config.json` on its own by running `gcloud auth configure-docker <region>-docker.pkg.dev`. Here is a sample entry it might create:

```
 {
    "credHelpers": {
        "<region>-docker.pkg.dev": "gcloud"
  }
}

```

## IAM

Ensure that you have correct permissions to push and pull the images. Please reference the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#grant) to ensure you have the correct permissions set.

## Run the Target

With the helper installed, no special To build and push an image, simply execute the build target. Don't forget the `--push` flag!

```
❯ earthly --push +build
           buildkitd | Found buildkit daemon as docker container (earthly-buildkitd)
         alpine:3.11 | --> Load metadata linux/amd64

              +build | Image +build as <region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project>/hello-earthly/hello-earthly:with-love (pushed)


```

## Pulling Images

Using this credential helper; you can also pull images without any special handling in an Earthfile:

```
FROM earthly/dind:alpine-main

run:
    WITH DOCKER --pull <region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project>/hello-earthly/hello-earthly:with-love
        RUN docker run <region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project>/hello-earthly/hello-earthly:with-love
    END
```

And here is how you would run it:

```
❯ earthly -P +run
           buildkitd | Found buildkit daemon as docker container (earthly-buildkitd)
  e/dind:alpine-main | --> Load metadata linux/amd64
