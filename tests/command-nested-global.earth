# foo should be overridden with the value "expected" to run this test.
# This asserts that the overriding scope impacts the global scope through nested
# DO calls.
ARG --global foo=default

SHARED:
    COMMAND
    # Note that foo has not yet been declared in the command, therefore we reference the globally declared arg
    RUN test "$foo" == "expected"

    # foo should be passed in as "baz" when DO +SHARED is called for the
    # purposes of this test. This ensures that DO args do not impact globals but
    # do impact ARGs that are declared in the COMMAND.
    ARG foo
    RUN test "$foo" == "baz"

CALLER:
    COMMAND
    RUN test "$foo" == "expected"

    ARG foo = "bar"
    RUN test "$foo" == "bar"
    DO +SHARED --foo="baz"

test-overriding:
    RUN test "$foo" == "expected"
    DO +CALLER
