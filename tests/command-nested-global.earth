# foo should be overridden with the value "expected" to run this test.
# This asserts that the overriding scope impacts the global scope through nested
# DO calls.

SHARED:
    COMMAND
    RUN test "$foo" == "expected"

    # foo should be passed in as "baz" when DO +SHARED is called for the
    # purposes of this test. This ensures that DO args do not impact globals but
    # do impact ARGs that are declared in the COMMAND.

CALLER:
